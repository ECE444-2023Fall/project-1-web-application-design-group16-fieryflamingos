## We Use MongoDB for our Database
We use MongoDB for our database to access all necessary data.

## Front-end with Bootstrap
We use Bootrstrap as our front-end framework for all front-end development.

## We use JIRA for Task Tracing
We use JIRA Software to track and manage all project tasks.

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report written by [briandk](https://gist.github.com/briandk). Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408), who is an app developer.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or things you tried that did not work)

Thorough bug reports always prove to be extremely beneficial.
